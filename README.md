# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a simple content-based movie recommendation system using the IMDB dataset. It demonstrates basic machine learning concepts and recommendation techniques.

## Functionality
- Loads and processes IMDB movie data
- Implements content-based filtering using movie features
- Recommends movies based on user input

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run
1. Ensure you're in the project directory
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python recommend_movies.py
   ```
3. When prompted, enter a movie title or description
4. The system will output a list of recommended movies based on your input

## What to Expect
- The system will process your input and compare it against the movie database
- It will return a list of 5-10 movie recommendations that are similar to your input
- Each recommendation will include the movie title and a brief explanation of why it was recommended

## Implementation Details
- Data loading and preprocessing using pandas
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Similarity calculation using cosine similarity
- Basic error handling and input validation

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- Currently uses a limited dataset; could be expanded for more comprehensive recommendations
- Doesn't account for user preferences or viewing history
- Future versions could incorporate collaborative filtering or hybrid approaches

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the recommendation system are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
