# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is part of the AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge and implements a simple content-based movie recommendation system using the IMDB dataset. It demonstrates basic machine learning concepts such as text vectorization and similarity measures to deliver movie recommendations based on input queries.

## Functionality
- Loads and processes IMDB movie data from a CSV file
- Implements content-based filtering using relevant movie features (description, genre, etc.)
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical feature vectors
- Calculates cosine similarity between movies to identify relevant recommendations
- Provides output recommendations based on user input

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aaryannb/movie-recommendations-.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd movie-recommendation
   ```
3. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Dependencies include:* pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn, and others.

## How to Run
1. Open your terminal or command prompt and ensure you're in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python recommend_movies.py
   ```
3. When prompted, enter a movie title or a descriptive query.
4. The system will process the input and display a list of 5-10 recommended movies along with brief explanations for each.

## What to Expect
- The system processes your textual input and matches it against the movie database.
- It returns a curated list of recommendations that are similar to your input.
- Recommendations include key details such as movie titles and brief reasoning based on similarity metrics.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Loading:** Uses pandas to load the IMDB dataset (IMBD.csv) into a DataFrame.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares movie data for analysis.
- **Vectorization:** Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert movie descriptions and genres into numerical features.
- **Similarity Measurement:** Applies cosine similarity to compare feature vectors.
- **Error Handling:** Implements basic error handling and input validation to ensure smooth performance.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- The current implementation is based on a limited dataset; expanding the dataset could enhance recommendation quality.
- User preferences and viewing history are not yet incorporated, which could be added in future versions.
- Future improvements may include integrating collaborative filtering or hybrid recommendation approaches for more personalized results.
